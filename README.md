I am a graduate student in Statistics at ETH Zurich, interested in anything related to Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Most of my repositories are private, but feel free to contact me if you catch something you would like to chat about. 

Most recently, I have been working on:
- Verifying robustness of neural networks with DeepPoly (deterministic, convex-relaxation based verification of ReLU and ReLU6-based architectures)
- Analyzing which parameters cause catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning framework
- Building predicitve signal for liquid assets from illiquid asset performance

A while ago, I was working on:
- An app that serves as a solution for emergency departements to plan staffing requirements and gain insights into patient flow characteristics
- A conditional Generative Adversarial Network to generate synthetic training examples for an image classifier
- Utilizing linear state-space models for a dynamic approach to cointegration-based optimal index tracking, and using the methodology to backtest stats arb strategies based on enhanced index tracking
