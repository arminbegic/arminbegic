I am a graduate student in Statistics at ETH Zurich, interested in anything related to Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Most of my repositories are private, but feel free to email me if you catch something you would like to chat about. 

Most recently, I have been working projects on 
- Verifying robustness of neural networks with 
- Analyzing which parameters cause catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning framework
- Building predicitve signal for liquid assets from illiquid asset performance
